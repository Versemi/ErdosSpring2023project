# Dataset Description and Problem Statement

**Dataset**: Yahoo Finance

The dataset for this project will be obtained from the Yahoo Finance API, which provides historical stock price data for a wide range of publicly traded companies. The dataset includes essential features such as opening and closing prices, high and low prices, trading volume, and adjusted close prices. These data points will serve as the basis for our stock price prediction models. No APIs are required to retrieve data from yfiance. 

**Objective**:
The objective of this project is to compare and evaluate different prediction models for stock price forecasting. We will explore the performance and accuracy of Polynomial Regression and Time Series Forecasting just to review the course materials first, and if time allows, LSTM and Bayesian methods would be further studied. Desirably, we would like to compare LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), a commonly used method in stock market prediction, with other more complex models such as Bayesian approaches. The project aims to examine the strengths and limitations of both LSTM and Bayesian models in capturing and predicting stock market dynamics. By evaluating the performance of these models on historical stock data, the project seeks to analyze their respective abilities to handle complex patterns, incorporate prior knowledge, and make accurate predictions. The comparison will involve assessing factors such as prediction accuracy, computational efficiency, interpretability, and scalability. Through this analysis, the project aims to provide insights into the trade-offs and benefits of using LSTM and Bayesian models in stock market prediction, shedding light on the suitability of each approach for different prediction scenarios.

**Stakeholders**:
Investors and Traders
Financial Analysts
Financial Institutions

**KPIs**:
General backtesting 
Vlatility/Returns 
Accuracy of predictions 
Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Computational efficiency

By conducting a thorough analysis of the Yahoo Finance dataset and implementing various prediction models, this project will provide insights and guidance for stock price prediction. It will enable stakeholders to make informed investment decisions, enhance their financial analysis capabilities, and improve trading strategies.
