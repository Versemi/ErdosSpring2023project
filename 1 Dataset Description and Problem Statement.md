# Dataset Description and Problem Statement

**Dataset**: Yahoo Finance

The dataset for this project will be obtained from the Yahoo Finance API, which provides historical stock price data for a wide range of publicly traded companies. The dataset includes essential features such as opening and closing prices, high and low prices, trading volume, and adjusted close prices. These data points will serve as the basis for our stock price prediction models. No APIs are required to retrieve data from yfiance. 

**Objective**:

The goal of this project is to assess and compare various prediction models for stock price forecasting. Initially, we will examine regression and time-series forecasting models to review their performance and accuracy. Subsequently, we will delve into the LSTM model, widely utilized in the quantitative finance domain, to evaluate its effectiveness and determine how it fares in comparison.

**Stakeholders**:

Investors and Traders
Financial Analysts
Financial Institutions

**KPIs**:

General backtesting 
Volatility/Returns 
Accuracy of predictions 
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Return on Investment (ROI)
Computational efficiency

By conducting a thorough analysis of the Yahoo Finance dataset and implementing various prediction models, this project will provide insights and guidance for stock price prediction. It will enable stakeholders to make informed investment decisions, enhance their financial analysis capabilities, and improve trading strategies.
