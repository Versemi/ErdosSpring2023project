Proposal of Modeling Approach:

**1. Test Linearity Assumptions:**
- Perform scatter plots and correlation analysis to assess the linear relationships between variables.
- Use techniques like residual plots to check for linearity assumptions between the target variable and predictors.
- Consider applying transformations or non-linear modeling techniques if linearity assumptions are violated.

**2. Dimensionality Reduction:**
- Utilize dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or feature selection methods to reduce the number of predictors.
- Assess the importance of each predictor using feature importance techniques or statistical tests to identify relevant features for modeling.
- Evaluate the impact of dimensionality reduction on model performance and interpretability.

**3. Modeling Approach:**
- Based on the data characteristics, consider the following modeling techniques:
  - Linear Regression: Build a multiple linear regression model to capture the relationships between predictors and the target variable.
  - Time Series Forecasting: Apply time series forecasting techniques like ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing to model temporal patterns and seasonality in the data.
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Utilize LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network, to capture temporal dependencies and nonlinear patterns in time series data.

**4. Model Evaluation:**
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
- Assess the performance of each model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or R-squared.
- Compare the performance of different models using cross-validation techniques or hold-out validation.
